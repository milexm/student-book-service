# Student Book Service
The **student-book-service** allows to create and manage a list of students. You can use it to organize your student list which you can access at any time from anywhere an Internet connection is available. The service can be used by anyone from students, to faculty, from professionals on the roads to anyone that needs the list readly available. 
The fairly simple interface allows easy access via your laptop or cell phone.


## Conceptual
The **student-book-service** is built in Java using the Spring Boot technology. See [Spring Boot for Beginners in 10 Steps](https://courses.in28minutes.com/p/spring-boot-for-beginners-in-10-steps). It also integrates Swagger libraries for the generatioon of documentation. See [Springfox Reference Documentation](https://springfox.github.io/springfox/docs/current/). 

The following is the service class or architecture diagram. 

![class diagram](student-book-service-classes.gif)

### Service Architectural Elements

- **SpringBoot2RestServiceApplication.java**. The Spring Boot Application class generated with **Spring Initializer**. This class acts as the launching point for the application.
- **Student.java**. Student JPA Entity.
- **StudentRepository.java**. Student JPA Repository. It is created using Spring Data JpaRepository.
- **StudentResource.java**. *Spring REST Controller* exposing all services on the student resource.
- **data.sql**. Contains initial data for the student table. Spring Boot executes this script after the tables are created from the entities.
- **ApiDocumentationConfig.java**. Meta Information about the API included in the documentation.
- **SwaggerConfig.java**. Contains the *Swagger Configuration* for generating documentation from the inline comments. 
- **pom.xml**. Contains all the dependencies needed to build this project. We will use **Spring Boot Starter AOP**.

### Prerequisites
To build the service you need the following:

- [Maven 3.0+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) as your build tool.
- Your favorite IDE. We use [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/).
- [JDK 1.8+](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).




### About the Documentation
API documentation is an essential part of a well rounded REST service. This example generates documentation from inline comments in the code. In particulare the example uses [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) the most popular REST API documentation standard. 
 
The generated Swagger UI is similar to the following:
![student-book-service-ui](student-book-service-ui.png) 

## Quick Start
The following examples are executed on a Web server, for example Tomcat, running on localhost.  

### Prerequisites
<div style="background-color:orange">🚨To run the client app, you must assure first that the related service is up and running on the localhost port 8282.</div>

1. In Eclipse, right click on the **student-book-service** server app.
1. From the drop down menu select **Run As->Spring Boot App**, as shon in the following figure.
 <img src="student-book-server-run.png" alt="server run" width="400" align="inline"></img>
3. If the port 8282 on which the service must run is busy perform the following steps (on Mac):

		>> sudo lsof -i tcp:8282 /* display the processes running on port 8282 */
		>> kill -9 p#1 p#2 /* Kill the processes specified by their Id numbers. 


### Examples
#### POST
Open a terminal window and execute a curl command simnilar to the following:

		curl -X POST "https://localhost:8282/students" 
		-H "accept: application/json" 
		-H "Content-Type: application/json" 
		-d "{ 	\"email\": \"mikes@gmail.com\", 
				\"id\": 10007, 
				\"name\": \"mike smith\", 
				\"phoneNumber\": \"253 333 4444\"
			}" 
		
The following record is added to the book:

	{	"id":10007,
		"name":"mike smith",
		"email":"mikes@gmail.com",
		"phoneNumber":"253 333 4444"
	}
	

#### GET
After executing the POST command execute the following GET command to get all the student records:

	curl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 
	http://localhost:8282/students

You wil get a response similar to the following:

	{
	  "id" : 10001,
	  "name" : "George Washington",
	  "email" : "georgew@email.com",
	  "phoneNumber" : "253 222 3456"
	}, {
	  "id" : 10002,
	  "name" : "Lucas Davenport",
	  "email" : "lucasd@email.com",
	  "phoneNumber" : "425 123 4567"
	}, {
	  "id" : 10003,
	  "name" : "Mary Smith",
	  "email" : "marys@email.com",
	  "phoneNumber" : "360 234 5678"
	}, {	"id":10007,
		"name":"mike smith",
		"email":"mikes@gmail.com",
		"phoneNumber":"253 333 4444"
	}
 
Execute the following command to obtain the new student record:

	curl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 
	http://localhost:8282/students/10007

You get the following response:

	{	"id":10007,
		"name":"mike smith",
		"email":"mikes@gmail.com",
		"phoneNumber":"253 333 4444"
	}

	
### Using a Client App
